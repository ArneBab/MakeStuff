</p>

<p> This directory contains makefile templates, include files, and scripts
    related to music -- lyrics, recordings, and so on.  The
    templates (capitalized) are meant to be symlinked as
    <code>Makefile</code>s; the include files (lower case) are meant to be
    included.  The generic include files in <a href="../make" >../make</a>
    were a later development, but will be used in the future.
</p>
<p> Note that everything here has been moved from <a href="../" >Tools/</a>;
    it will take a while before they all get moved here and converted to the
    new Makefile system.  In the mean time, symlinks have been left in place.
</p>

<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>
<h3>Templates</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Album.make" ><del>Album.make</del></a> (deprecated)
  <dd> The old album makefile.  Can't simply be replaced with Record because
       of some differences in directory layout.
  <dt> <a href="Concert.make" ><del>Concert.make</del></a> (deprecated)
  <dd> The old concert makefile.  Can't simply be replaced with Record because
       of some differences in directory layout.
  <dt> <a href="Practice.make" ><del>Practice.make</del></a> (deprecated)
  <dd> The old practice session makefile.  Can't simply be replaced with
       Record because of some differences in directory layout.
</dl>
<p> The deprecated templates will be removed once the directories that use
    them have been tracked down and converted.  Record.make has already been
    replaced. 
</p>

<h3>Include Files</h3>
<dl>
  <!--
  <dt> <a href=".make" >.make</a>
  <dd>
    -->
  <dt> <a href="lyrcs.make" >lyrics.make</a>
  <dd> Replacement for */Lyrics/Makefile.  None of these are symlinked; they
       have subtle differences that will make conversion a bit challenging.
       In addition, future plans require multiple lyrics directories, to allow
       songbooks with appropriate rights to be distributed via public git
       repositories. 
  <dt> <a href="record.make" >record.make</a>
  <dd> Replacement for Record.make (which in turn is symlinked from
       ../record.make) meant to be included from a <code>config.make</code>
  <dt> <a href="songs.make" >songs.make</a>
  <dd> Include for */Songs.  Currently only users/steve has a Songs
       directory. 
  <dt> <a href="track-depends.make" >track-depends.make</a>
  <dd> Rules for use in a Tracks subdirectory; the makefile there is
       auto-generated.  This could be replaced with a Makefile symlink
       and an auto-generated .depends.make, at this point.
</dl>

<h3>Scripts</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="trackinfo" >trackinfo</a>
  <dd> Get information about a track, and print it on STDOUT in a wide variety
       of formats.  Should really be broken up into parsing and display
       modules. 
  <dt> <a href="list-tracks" >list-tracks</a>
  <dd> List a Tracks subdirectory in a format useful when recording an album.
  <dt> <a href="transpose" >transpose</a>
  <dd> Transpose chords in a <code>.flk</code> file (or any other file with
       chord symbols in []).
  <dd> <a href="flktran" >flktran</a> (WIP)
  <dt> Convert a <code>.flk</code> file to plain text or html.
</dl>
<p> Note that, for historical reasons, much of the code that formats or
    otherwise works with lyrics is located in <a href="../TeX"
    ><code>../TeX</code></a>.
