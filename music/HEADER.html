<p> This directory contains makefile templates, include files, and scripts
    related to music -- lyrics, recordings, and so on.  The
    templates (capitalized) are meant to be symlinked as
    <code>Makefile</code>s; the include files (lower case) are meant to be
    included.  The generic include files in <a href="../make" >../make</a>
    were a later development, but will be used in the future.
</p>
<p> Note that everything here has been moved from <a href="../" >Tools/</a>;
    it will take a while before they all get moved here and converted to the
    new Makefile system.  In the mean time, symlinks have been left in place.
</p>

<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>
<h3>Templates</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Album.make" ><del>Album.make</del></a> (deprecated)
  <dd> The old album makefile.  Can't simply be replaced with Record because
       of some differences in directory layout.
  <dt> <a href="Concert.make" ><del>Concert.make</del></a> (deprecated)
  <dd> The old concert makefile.  Can't simply be replaced with Record because
       of some differences in directory layout.
  <dt> <a href="Practice.make" ><del>Practice.make</del></a> (deprecated)
  <dd> The old practice session makefile.  Can't simply be replaced with
       Record because of some differences in directory layout.
</dl>
<p> The deprecated templates will be removed once the directories that use
    them have been tracked down and converted.  Record.make has already been
    replaced. 
</p>

<h3>Include Files</h3>
<dl>
  <!--
  <dt> <a href=".make" >.make</a>
  <dd>
    -->
  <dt> <a href="lyrcs.make" >lyrics.make</a>
  <dd> Replacement for */Lyrics/Makefile.  None of these are symlinked; they
       have subtle differences that will make conversion a bit challenging.
       In addition, future plans require multiple lyrics directories, to allow
       songbooks with appropriate rights to be distributed via public git
       repositories. 
  <dt> <a href="record.make" >record.make</a>
  <dd> Replacement for Record.make (which in turn is symlinked from
       ../record.make) meant to be included from a <code>config.make</code>
  <dt> <a href="songs.make" >songs.make</a>
  <dd> Include for */Songs.  Currently only users/steve has a Songs
       directory. 
  <dt> <a href="track-depends.make" >track-depends.make</a>
  <dd> Rules for use in a Tracks subdirectory; the makefile there is
       auto-generated.  This could be replaced with a Makefile symlink
       and an auto-generated .depends.make, at this point.
</dl>

<h3>Scripts</h3>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="TrackInfo.pl"><code>TrackInfo.pl</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Extract and format track information.  Gets song metadata from the
       appropriate <code>.flk</code> files (basically LaTeX with a lot of
       custom macros), and track metadata from whichever <code>.wav</code>
       file is most appropriate.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="list-tracks"><code>list-tracks</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> List either all known tracks, or a specific set of tracks (e.g. the
       ones in an album's track list), in a format that makes it easy to
       keep (cough) <em>track</em> of recording progress.  Most of the
       information comes out of a file called <code>notes</code> in the
       track directory.  With the "<code>-i</code>" option, it lists key,
       meter, tempo, and style; these are useful when you're trying not to
       put excessively-similar tracks together.  Otherwise it appends the
       last line of <code>notes</code> that starts in column 1; by
       convention this describes the most recent useable take.  In a very
       real sense, this command produces a compact "status/to-do" list for
       an album.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="transpose"><code>transpose</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Transpose a file that contains chord symbols in square brackets:
       ChordPro, FlkTran, etc.
  </dd>
</dl>
