this[A] is gg [g\aug7\sharp5]lllline
this is [C\dim7\flat5]another [F\maj7]line
\\
this is another verse
as is this, which we extend a bit to see the effect of:
\begin{refrain}
  this is a [C\min9]Refrain
  this is more refrain (chorus)
\end{refrain}
and this is another verse
with another line in it.
\Indented{refrain}
and a last verse
\begin{refrain}
 with a second refrain
\end{refrain}
\end{song}
