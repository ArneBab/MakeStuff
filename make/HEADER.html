<p> This directory contains makefile templates and include files.  The
    templates (capitalized) are meant to be symlinked as
    <code>Makefile</code>s; the include files (lower case) are meant to be
    included.
</p>
<p> Note that templates have historically been located in <a href="../"
    >Tools/</a>; it will take a while before they all get moved here.
