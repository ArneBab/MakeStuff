<h1>MakeStuff</h1>

<p> MakeStuff contains the Makefiles and associated scripts that I use to
    build essentially all of my websites and projects, most notably <a
    href="http://steve.savitzky.net/">steve.savitzky.net</a>.  They have been
    evolving over the course of several decades (the earliest recorded commit
    dates back to 1994, and the tree was converted from CVS to git in 2010,
    but some of the scripts date back at least a decade earlier), so they
    still contain a certain amount of cruft.

<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>

<h3>Directories</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="TeX/" >TeX/</a> </dt>
  <dd> LaTeX styles for formatting FilkTeX ("<code>.flk</code>") files, plus
       the tools for translating them into HTML (<code>flktran.pl</code>) and
       generating index pages (<code>index.pl</code>).  These are all showing
       their age, and need to be given an honorable retirement.  In particular
       the LaTeX styles need to be updated for LaTeX 5e, and indexing needs to
       be done using Perl scripts derived from <code>TrackInfo.pl</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="deployment/" >deployment</a> </dt>
  <dd> Git hooks and related tools for efficient website deployment.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="include/" >include</a> </dt>
  <dd> Files to be included in compilations or inserted into source code and
       documentation.  Mostly contains various forms of license notice, in a
       format suitable for use with <code>boilermaker.pl</code>, and templates
       for use with <code>replace-template-file.pl</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="make/" >make</a> </dt>
  <dd> The general-purpose <code>*.make</code> files included by
       <code>Makefile</code>. 
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="music/" >music</a> </dt>
  <dd> The <code>*.make</code> files and associated scripts used in music- and
       recording-related subdirectories and projects.  Currently poorly
       integrated with FilkTex, and lightly documented.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="scripts/" >scripts</a> </dt>
  <dd> Short scripts and fragments, mostly having to do with setting up and
       maintaining subprojects using git.
  </dd>

<h3>Makefile</h3>
<p> Makefile is the heart and soul of MakeStuff.  It's really just a
    framework: it figures out where the MakeStuff directory is by looking up
    the tree, and includes what it needs.  It's designed so that you don't
    have to maintain a separate Makefile in each subdirectory, just make a
    symlink to the one in MakeStuff.  Usually, the top-level Makefile in a
    project is a symlink to <code>./MakeStuff/Makefile</code> and everything
    else links to <code>../Makefile</code>.
</p>
<p> The <code>Makefile</code> looks for the following local include files:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt> <code>[.]site/config.make</code> </dt>
  <dd> Only in the top-level directory; this contains make rules, definitions,
       and dependencies that apply to the entire tree.
  </dd>
  <dt> <code>[.]site/targets.make</code> </dt>
  <dd> This contains rules and targets.
  </dd>
  <dt> <code>[.]site/depends.make</code> </dt>
  <dd> This also contains targets; if you have both, you can use this one for
       specific targets with dependencies.
  </dd>
  <dt> <code>*/[.]config.make</code> </dt>
  <dd> Only in the top-level directory; this contains make rules, definitions,
       and dependencies that apply to the entire tree.
  </dd>
  <dt> <code>*/[.]depends.make</code> </dt>
  <dd> This also contains targets; if you have both, you can use this one for
       specific targets with dependencies.
  </dd>
</dl>


<h3>HEADER.html</h3>

<p> Unlike most other directories on this website, where the
    <code>HEADER.html</code> file is hidden from casual browsing by an
    <code>index.html</code> file, <em>this</em> directory deliberately leaves
    <code>HEADER.html</code> out where you can see it.  Whenever I have
    control over a programming project, I make its directory tree look like a
    website -- you will almost always find a <code>HEADER.html</code> file
    like this one, in every subdirectory.  The <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/" >Apache</a> web server puts a
    <code>HEADER.html</code> file, if you have one, at the top of a directory
    listing.  (It puts <code>README.html</code> at the bottom, after the file
    list.)  With a little tweaking you can get similar behavior with
    plain-text <code>HEADER</code> and <code>README</code>, but you can't
    always count on having enough control over a hosted website's
    configuration.
</p>
<p> This particular directory contains tools for working on website- and
    music-related projects: the tools used on <em>this website</em> and the
    projects you find here.  (Source code for other, unrelated open-source
    projects can be found in <a href="../Src/" >../Src/</a>.)
</p>


<h3>Other Files</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="MIT-LICENSE.txt"><code>MIT-LICENSE.txt</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> What it says on the tin -- the license for this project and its contents.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="to.do"><code>to.do</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> The to-do list for this directory.  You can probably find some in other
       directories if you look.  The format is trivial: an open circle
       (lowercase "o") is something that's not finished yet; a filled circle
       (asterisk) is finished.  "~" indicates something I've decided not to
       do, and "?" indicates something I'm dithering about.  Eventually
       finished items move to a "done" section or, when they start getting
       moldy, a separate file.
