<p> Unlike most other directories on this website, where the HEADER.html file
    is hidden from casual browsing by an <code>index.html</code> file,
    <em>this</em> file is all you're likely to get.  Whenever I have
    control over a programming project, I make its directory tree look like a
    website -- you will <em>always</em> find a HEADER.html file like this one,
    in every subdirectory.  The <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/"
    >Apache</a> webserver puts a HEADER.html file, if you have one,
    at the top of a directory listing.  (It puts README.html at the
    bottom, after the file list.)  With a little tweaking you can get similar
    behavior with plain-text HEADER and README, but you can't always count on
    having enough control over a hosted website's configuration.

<p> This particular directory contains tools for working on website- and
    music-related projects: the tools used on <em>this website</em> and the
    projects you find here.  (Source code for other, unrelated open-source
    projects can be found in <a href="../Src/" >../Src/</a>.)

<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>

<h3>Directories</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="TeX/" >TeX/</a> </dt>
  <dd> LaTeX styles for formatting FilkTeX ("<code>.flk</code>") files, plus
       the tools for translating them into HTML (<code>flktran.pl</code>) and
       generating index pages (<code>index.pl</code>).  These are all showing
       their age, and need to be given an honorable retirement.  In particular
       the LaTeX styles need to be updated for LaTeX 5e, and indexing needs to
       be done using <code>SongInfo.pl</code>.

<h3>Makefile templates</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="album.make"><code>album.make</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Makefile template for "album" subdirectories.  Has targets for things
       like burning CD-Rs and managing track lists.

  <dd>

<h3>Scripts</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="list-tracks"><code>list-tracks</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> List either all known tracks, or a specific set of tracks (e.g. the
       ones in an album's track list), in a format that makes it easy to keep
       (cough) <em>track</em> of recording progress.
