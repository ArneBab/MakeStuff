<p> Unlike most other directories on this website, where the
    <code>HEADER.html</code> file is hidden from casual browsing by an
    <code>index.html</code> file, <em>this</em> directory deliberately leaves
    <code>HEADER.html</code> out where you can see it.  Whenever I have
    control over a programming project, I make its directory tree look like a
    website -- you will <em>always</em> find a <code>HEADER.html</code> file
    like this one, in every subdirectory.  The <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/" >Apache</a> web server puts a
    <code>HEADER.html</code> file, if you have one, at the top of a directory
    listing.  (It puts <code>README.html</code> at the bottom, after the file
    list.)  With a little tweaking you can get similar behavior with
    plain-text <code>HEADER</code> and <code>README</code>, but you can't
    always count on having enough control over a hosted website's
    configuration.
</p>
<p> This particular directory contains tools for working on website- and
    music-related projects: the tools used on <em>this website</em> and the
    projects you find here.  (Source code for other, unrelated open-source
    projects can be found in <a href="../Src/" >../Src/</a>.)

<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>

<h3>Directories</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="TeX/" >TeX/</a> </dt>
  <dd> LaTeX styles for formatting FilkTeX ("<code>.flk</code>") files, plus
       the tools for translating them into HTML (<code>flktran.pl</code>) and
       generating index pages (<code>index.pl</code>).  These are all showing
       their age, and need to be given an honorable retirement.  In particular
       the LaTeX styles need to be updated for LaTeX 5e, and indexing needs to
       be done using <code>SongInfo.pl</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="include/" >include</a> </dt>
  <dd> Files to be included in compilations or inserted into source code and
       documentation.  Mostly contains various forms of license notice, in a
       format suitable for use with either <code>boilermaker.pl</code> or
       <code>replace-template-file.pl</code>.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Makefile templates</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="album.make"><code>album.make</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Makefile template for "Album" subdirectories.  Has targets for things
       like burning CD-Rs and managing track lists.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="concert.make"><code>concert.make</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Makefile template for "Concert" subdirectories.  Basically similar to
       <code>album.make</code> except that all the audio files are local to
       the directory instead of being pulled from <code><a href="../Tracks/"
       >Tracks</a></code>. 
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="publish.make"><code>publish.make</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Makefile template for working directories that have to be "published"
       to a web staging directory.  Relies on having a symlink called
       <code>PUBDIR</code> someplace up the tree that points to the web
       directory. 
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="track-depends.make"><code>track-depends.make</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Used in the <code>mytracks.make</code> files automagically generated by
       <a href="album.make" >album.make</a> to handle the shifting set of
       dependencies that result from always using the most recently-exported
       <code>.wav</code> file in a track directory.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href=""><code></code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> 
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Scripts</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Setlist.cgi"><code>Setlist.cgi</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> This is the CGI script I use to make HTML setlists and tracklists.  It
       only works inside the firewall -- if you let a search engine spider it,
       you end up with a combinatorial explosion that blows your site's
       bandwidth to smithereens.  I've been there, and you've been warned.  At
       some point I'll do a drag&amp;drop version in Javascript, which will be
       both faster for users and safer for search engines.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="SongInfo.pl"><code>SongInfo.pl</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Extract song information from a <code>.flk</code> file (basically LaTeX
       with a lot of custom macros) and print it on STDOUT in any of several
       useful formats.  Once used extensively in <code>album.make</code>, it
       has now largely been replaced by <code>TrackInfo.pl</code>
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="TrackInfo.pl"><code>TrackInfo.pl</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Extract and format track information.  Essentially the same as
       <code>SongInfo.pl</code> except that it also looks at information in
       the local directory and in the <code><a href="../Tracks/"
       >Tracks</a></code> directory.  Especially useful for concert
       recordings, which tend to have an eclectic mix of songs, two-song
       tracks, introductions, and sometimes a little pure weirdness.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="list-tracks"><code>list-tracks</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> List either all known tracks, or a specific set of tracks (e.g. the
       ones in an album's track list), in a format that makes it easy to keep
       (cough) <em>track</em> of recording progress.  Most of the information
       comes out of a file called <code>notes</code> in the track directory.
       With the "<code>-i</code>" option, it lists key, meter, tempo, and
       style; these are useful when you're trying not to put
       excessively-similar tracks together.  Otherwise it appends the last
       line of <code>notes</code> that starts in column 1; by convention this
       describes the most recent useable take.  In a very real sense, this
       command produces a compact "to-do" list for an album.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="boilermaker.pl"
       ><code>boilermaker.pl</code> </a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Insert license boilerplate, in the form of a comment, into any of
       several different kinds of scripts.  Understands hashmark, C, and *ML
       comments.  Note that what it inserts into HTML is a comment: it does
       <em>not</em> insert a license notice that can be read in a browser.
       Use <code>replace-template-file.pl</code> for that.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="replace-template-file.pl"
       ><code>replace-template-file.pl</code> </a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Uses a template file to replace a matching section in one or more
       files.  Used primarily for updating album song lists.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href=""><code></code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> 
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Other Files</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="to.do"><code>to.do</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> The to-do list for this directory.  You can probably find some in other
       directories if you look.  The format is trivial: an open circle
       (lowercase "o") is something that's not finished yet; a filled circle
       (asterisk) is finished.  "~" indicates something I've decided not to
       do, and "?" indicates something I'm dithering about.  Eventually
       finished items move to a "done" section or, when they start getting
       moldy, a separate file.
  </dd>
