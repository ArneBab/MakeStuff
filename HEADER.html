<p> Unlike most other directories on this website, where the
    <code>HEADER.html</code> file is hidden from casual browsing by an
    <code>index.html</code> file, <em>this</em> directory deliberately leaves
    <code>HEADER.html</code> out where you can see it.  Whenever I have
    control over a programming project, I make its directory tree look like a
    website -- you will <em>always</em> find a <code>HEADER.html</code> file
    like this one, in every subdirectory.  The <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/" >Apache</a> web server puts a
    <code>HEADER.html</code> file, if you have one, at the top of a directory
    listing.  (It puts <code>README.html</code> at the bottom, after the file
    list.)  With a little tweaking you can get similar behavior with
    plain-text <code>HEADER</code> and <code>README</code>, but you can't
    always count on having enough control over a hosted website's
    configuration.
</p>
<p> This particular directory contains tools for working on website- and
    music-related projects: the tools used on <em>this website</em> and the
    projects you find here.  (Source code for other, unrelated open-source
    projects can be found in <a href="../Src/" >../Src/</a>.)

<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>

<h3>Directories</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="TeX/" >TeX/</a> </dt>
  <dd> LaTeX styles for formatting FilkTeX ("<code>.flk</code>") files, plus
       the tools for translating them into HTML (<code>flktran.pl</code>) and
       generating index pages (<code>index.pl</code>).  These are all showing
       their age, and need to be given an honorable retirement.  In particular
       the LaTeX styles need to be updated for LaTeX 5e, and indexing needs to
       be done using <code>TrackInfo.pl</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="include/" >include</a> </dt>
  <dd> Files to be included in compilations or inserted into source code and
       documentation.  Mostly contains various forms of license notice, in a
       format suitable for use with either <code>boilermaker.pl</code> or
       <code>replace-template-file.pl</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="makefiles/" >makefiles</a> </dt>
  <dd> An earlier but still usable collection of makefile fragments meant to
       be <code>include</code>d from a local <code>Makefile</code>.  
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="scripts/" >scripts</a> </dt>
  <dd> Short scripts and fragments, mostly one-shot mass fixups.  Customize as
       needed.
</dl>

<h3>Makefile templates</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="record.make"><code>record.make</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Makefile template for audio recordings, including albums, concerts, and
       practice sessions.  Has targets for things like burning CD-Rs and
       managing track lists.  Replaces the now-obsolete <a href="album.make"
       >album.make</a>, <a href="concert.make" >concert.make</a>, and <a
       href="practice.make" >practice.make</a> (which have, however, been kept
       around to keep from breaking older parts of the site).
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="publish.make"><code>publish.make</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Makefile template for working directories that have to be "published"
       to a web staging directory.  Relies on having a symlink called
       <code>PUBDIR</code> someplace up the tree that points to the web
       directory.   Obsolete, but could still be useful for sites relying on
       FTP or SFTP.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="track-depends.make"><code>track-depends.make</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Used in the <code>mytracks.make</code> files automagically generated by
       <a href="album.make" >album.make</a> to handle the shifting set of
       dependencies that result from always using the most recently-exported
       <code>.wav</code> file in a track directory.  
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href=""><code></code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> 
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Scripts</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <b>Music Metadata:</b>
  </dt>
  <dd> These are all used for extracting various kinds of metadata from
       lyrics, tracks, and track notes. 
    <dl>
      <dt> <a href="TrackInfo.pl"><code>TrackInfo.pl</code></a>
      </dt>
      <dd> Extract and format track information.  Gets song metadata from the
	   appropriate <code>.flk</code> files (basically LaTeX with a lot of
	   custom macros), and track metadata from whichever <code>.wav</code>
	   file is most appropriate.
      </dd>
      <dt> <a href="list-tracks"><code>list-tracks</code></a>
      </dt>
      <dd> List either all known tracks, or a specific set of tracks (e.g. the
	   ones in an album's track list), in a format that makes it easy to
	   keep (cough) <em>track</em> of recording progress.  Most of the
	   information comes out of a file called <code>notes</code> in the
	   track directory.  With the "<code>-i</code>" option, it lists key,
	   meter, tempo, and style; these are useful when you're trying not to
	   put excessively-similar tracks together.  Otherwise it appends the
	   last line of <code>notes</code> that starts in column 1; by
	   convention this describes the most recent useable take.  In a very
	   real sense, this command produces a compact "status/to-do" list for
	   an album.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt> <b>File Updating:</b>
  </dt>
  <dd> These are all used for updating existing files in place; because they
       are used in Makefiles, it's essential that they not modify a file that
       is already up to date.
    <dl>
      <dt> <a href="boilermaker.pl"
	   ><code>boilermaker.pl</code> </a>
      </dt>
      <dd> Insert license boilerplate, in the form of a comment, into any of
	   several different kinds of files.  Understands hashmark, C, TeX,
	   Lisp, and *ML comments.  Note that what it inserts into HTML is a
	   comment: it does <em>not</em> insert a license notice that can be
	   read in a browser.  Use <code>replace-template-file.pl</code> for
	   that.
      </dd>
      <dt> <a href="replace-template-file.pl"
	   ><code>replace-template-file.pl</code> </a>
      </dt>
      <dd> Uses a template file to replace a matching section in one or more
	   files.  Currently used primarily for updating album song lists.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt> <b>Hacks:</b>
  </dt>
  <dd> Assorted hacks.  These would deserve their own directory if
       there were more of them.
    <dl>
      <dt> <a href="twitter.lsp"><code>twitter.lsp</code></a>
      </dt>
      <dd> A program in <a
	   href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rbd/doc/nyquist/root.html"
	   >Nyquist</a> lisp used to generate fake modem tones for <a
	   href="../Songs/vampire.html" ><cite>Vampire Megabyte</cite></a>.
      </dd>
      <dt> <a href=""><code></code></a>
      </dt>
      <dd> 
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Other Files</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="to.do"><code>to.do</code></a>
  </dt>
  <dd> The to-do list for this directory.  You can probably find some in other
       directories if you look.  The format is trivial: an open circle
       (lowercase "o") is something that's not finished yet; a filled circle
       (asterisk) is finished.  "~" indicates something I've decided not to
       do, and "?" indicates something I'm dithering about.  Eventually
       finished items move to a "done" section or, when they start getting
       moldy, a separate file.
  </dd>
