# TODO:
#	test more tag handling:  PD, REJ, web-ok
#	look at the song index files
#	add some audio files
#	At some point we may want to make 1subdir-index.mustache if it doesn't exist

### Files needed for setup

#FIXME:  copy test lyrics from music.data/Lyrics;
#	need music.data/Songs/1subdir-index.mustache for Songs
