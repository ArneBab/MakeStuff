<h1>About WURM</h1>

<h2>Beyond <code>make website</code></h2>

<p> WURM (Web Upload with Recursive Makefiles) is a complete website
    management package in the form of a set of <code>makefile</code>s --
    control files for GNU <code>make</code>.  The general idea is that you
    can go into a web directory, edit a file, and give commands
    like: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <code>make blog</code> </li>
  <li> <code>make feeds</code> </li>
  <li> <code>make upload</code></li>
  <li> <code>make backups</code></li>
</ul>

<p> Similarly, you can plug in your digital camera and say: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <code>make photos</code> </li>
  <li> <code>make thumbnails</code> </li>
  <li> <code>make gallery</code></li>
  <li> <code>make upload</code></li>
</ul>

<p> (Actually, it's simpler than that because, unless you need to be selective
    for some reason, you can simply say <code>make</code> and everything that
    needs doing will get done:  <code>make</code> is good that way.)
</p>

<p> WURM also happily takes "plug-ins" in the form of <code>make</code>
    "rules" that tell it how to handle particular classes of files.  If you
    want, for example, to run all your <code>.tex</code> files through
    <code>latex</code> to turn them into <code>.pdf</code> files, you can do
    it with about four lines of code.  WURM will, in fact, work will with
    <em>any</em> program that can be run in batch mode from a command line,
    including such blogging programs as <code>blosxom</code> and
    <code>nanoblogger</code>, and even text editors like Emacs and image
    editors like the Gimp.
</p>

<p> WURM works with multiple upload methods including <code>ftp</code>
    and <code>WebDAV</code> as well as the preferred <code>rsync</code> and
    <code>ssh</code>.  The general idea is to do as much work as possible on
    your local system (or a local server) <em>before</em> anything gets
    uploaded -- in most cases, all your web server has to do is serve static
    files and perhaps handle the occasional comment from a reader.
